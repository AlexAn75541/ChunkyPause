# Maximum number of players before pausing Chunky generation
# Set to -1 to disable player-based pausing
# Set to 0 to pause when any player joins
players: 0

# Memory usage threshold (0.0 to 1.0, where 1.0 is 100%)
# When memory exceeds this percentage, Chunky will be automatically paused
# 
# The plugin automatically detects your JDK and adjusts GC strategies:
# - Azul JDK detected: Single-pass GC (C4/ZGC is highly efficient)
# - Standard JDK: Multi-pass GC for thorough cleanup
# - mimalloc detected: Optimized GC with reduced fragmentation benefits
# 
# Recommended values:
# - Standard JDK: 0.80-0.85 (80-85%)
# - Azul JDK: 0.85-0.88 (85-88%) - Better memory management
# - Azul + mimalloc: 0.88-0.90 (88-90%) - Best performance
memory-threshold: 0.85

# How often to check memory usage (in ticks, 20 ticks = 1 second)
# Lower values = more frequent checks = more CPU usage but faster response
# 
# The plugin will automatically adapt its GC strategy based on detected JDK
# Default: 100 ticks = 5 seconds
check-interval: 100

# How long to wait before checking if memory has recovered (in ticks)
# After pausing due to high memory, the plugin will wait this long before checking again
# 
# Recommended values:
# - Standard JDK: 100 ticks (5 seconds) - GC takes longer
# - Azul JDK: 60 ticks (3 seconds) - Faster GC recovery
# Default: 100 ticks = 5 seconds
resume-delay: 100

# Clean memory (trigger garbage collection) when a player joins
# This helps prevent lag spikes when players join during heavy chunk generation
# 
# The plugin uses adaptive GC strategies:
# - Azul JDK: Fast, low-pause GC (minimal impact)
# - Standard JDK: Conservative multi-pass GC
# - With mimalloc: Enhanced efficiency in all cases
# 
# GC cooldown: 10 seconds (prevents excessive GC calls)
# Recommended: true (especially beneficial with Azul/mimalloc)
clean-memory-on-join: true
